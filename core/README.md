# @capacitor-plus/core

The core JavaScript/TypeScript runtime for Capacitor+.

## What is Capacitor+?

**Capacitor+** is an automated fork of [Capacitor](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor) maintained by [Capgo](https://capgo.app). It provides the same functionality as `@capacitor/core` with these benefits:

- **Faster Updates**: Get upstream fixes as soon as they pass CI, not months later
- **Community PRs Merged**: Valuable PRs stuck in the upstream queue are merged here
- **Security Reviewed**: Every change is analyzed by Claude Code for vulnerabilities
- **Drop-in Replacement**: Same API, just a different package scope

## Installation

```bash
npm install @capacitor-plus/core
```

## Why Use This Instead of @capacitor/core?

The official Capacitor release cycle can leave bug fixes and improvements waiting for months. Capacitor+ automatically syncs with upstream daily, runs full CI, and publishes verified releases immediately.

**Have a PR stuck in the Capacitor repo?** Open an issue linking to it, and we'll merge it here so you can use your fix today.

## Compatibility

This package maintains API compatibility with `@capacitor/core`. You can use it alongside Capacitor plugins designed for the official packages.
